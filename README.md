SafeWay: The Drone App

A monitored via internet or bluetooth showing data such as acceleration, tilt, temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, CO2 level in the air, altitude above sea level, and coordinates satellite location application, all this in real time to assist in decision-making of a safe flight. This data is displayed via a website or a mobile application.

Arduino Sensor Node contains the codes of the sensors that catch data in real time.

RPI Web Server gets the data on earth of the sensors and send it to the app.

Android Bluetooth contains the code of the Android app via bluetooth.

GeoWeather contains the code of the Android app via internet. That  integrate 100% WebServices to get Weather information from OpenData public API  (http://openweathermap.org/api) to  give  to the  drone's  pilot information and  alerts about  the weather, for exaple if is reining, or  if the  wind  speed is close to 30 km/h. Basic  information to waranty a SAFE WAY. Real information, from 12 sensors that has the drone to monitored othersaspects. In adition this mobile aplication deploy a dynamic map with all the areas that has restrictions in Bogota, then the pilot will be update about where the drone must to  be. 


All the solution, if for help the pilot and the community  to create a safe air space to  fly. 

The sensors and the  data captured, could be used to improbe the investigation.
